Ureport
=======
Ureport is a user-centered social monitoring tool designed to strengthen community-led development and citizen engagement. It allows users to speak out on what is happening in their community and feeds back useful information to assist users to enact change in your community.

Technically speaking, Ureport leverages the work of rapidsms-polls  to provide an easy system for polling a large number of users, and adds a visualization layer to aggregate poll results exposed in as JSON in the polling app.

A running example of ureport can be viewed at ureport.ug
